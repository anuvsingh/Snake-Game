# Snake Game
This is a simple Snake game developed in Java using NetBeans, AWT, and Swing. The game implements various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, such as arrays, loops, and collision detection. The game features a basic snake movement system, apple spawning, and collision detection, providing an interactive user experience.

## Features
- *Snake Movement*: The snake moves in four directions (left, right, up, down), and the movement is controlled using the arrow keys.
- *Mouse Spawning*: Mouse randomly spawn on the game board, and when the snake eats the apple, it grows longer.
- *Collision Detection*: The game detects collisions with the snakeâ€™s body and the boundaries of the game area. If the snake collides with itself or the boundaries, the game ends.
- *Scoring*: The score is based on how many mouse the snake eats. The more mouse the snake eats, the longer the snake grows.
- *Game Over*: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the board boundaries. A message is displayed indicating the end of the game.

## Technologies Used
- *Java*: The primary programming language used for building the game logic and graphics.
- *NetBeans*: The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
- *AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit)*: Used for handling the game window and graphics.
- *Swing*: Used for the graphical user interface (GUI) components.
- *Timer*: Used to control the speed of the game.
